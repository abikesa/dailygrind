# Jupyter-book
In May 2023, I decided to completely dispense with Microsoft office suites `.xlsx`, `.ppt`, and `docx`, as well as `.pdf`. My chains would by `.ipynb`, deployed on `gh-pages`, via `ghp-import` from my local `VScode`

So this has nothing to do with a bias against Microsoft. I've been more embedded in their ecosystem, with a montly suscription for `co-pilot`.

And so the question is simple: can I deploy and update content daintely, in these fetters, as I would with the customary office suit? The answer is in the affirmative thanks to automation of virtually all processes!
