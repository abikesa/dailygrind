What I've been [working on](https://abikesa.github.io/digital/chapter5.html) has been uncommunicable:
- `Plugin` to clinical research output
- Individualizes inferences
- Footprint of availble and missing data is explicity
- Allows end-user to simulate distribution of missingness
- Simulation uses same inputs:
   - data points (base-case function)
   - parameters (beta-coefficient vector), and
   - weights (variance-covariance matrix)
- Harnesses platform for Bayesian inferences
   - Data missing
   - But we know the bounds of the parameters 

# Analogy
- Compute (OpenAI)
- Ecce-homo (Nietzsche)
- Bipolar (Kanye)
- Gladwells outliers (Mozart)
- Practice makes ...
- Epilepsy (Dostoevsky, St. Paul)

# Notes

In the realms of music, dance, and art, "uncommunicable" might refer to the deeply personal or abstract elements that defy conventional expression or understanding. These are aspects that can be experienced or felt but are challenging to articulate or translate into words.

**Music:** There are elements of music, such as the emotional resonance of a particular melody or the impact of a complex harmonic progression, that might be felt deeply by a listener yet are difficult to describe adequately. Certain pieces or performances evoke a profound emotional response that words fail to capture, making the experience uncommunicable.

**Dance:** The nuances of movement, the subtlety of a dancer's expression, and the way a dance piece can convey complex emotions or narratives through motion can be uncommunicable. The physicality and kinesthetic empathy evoked by dance are often beyond verbal explanation, leaving only the experience itself as a true conveyance of meaning.

**Art:** Visual art, whether it be painting, sculpture, or installation, often contains layers of meaning, emotion, and intention that are uncommunicable. The personal reaction to a piece of art, the way it resonates with an individual's experiences and emotions, or the abstract ideas it represents, can be deeply personal and not easily conveyed through language.

These uncommunicable aspects of music, dance, and art underscore the power of these mediums to connect with people on a level beyond the rational or linguistic, tapping into a more primal and profound mode of human experience.
