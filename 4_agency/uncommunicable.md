What I've been [working on](https://abikesa.github.io/digital/chapter5.html) has been uncommunicable:
- `Plugin` to clinical research output
- Individualizes inferences
- Footprint of availble and missing data is explicity
- Allows end-user to simulate distribution of missingness
- Simulation uses same inputs:
   - data points (base-case function)
   - parameters (beta-coefficient vector), and
   - weights (variance-covariance matrix)
- Harnesses platform for Bayesian inferences
   - Data missing
   - But we know the bounds of the parameters
