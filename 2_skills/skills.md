## Bespoke
1. THB-St.Paul, Radio, Ariana? Shazam-like, Who-sampled
2. My idea inspired by Oscar Peterson's Withcraft
3. Qualities Dim & Aug now clearly for passing chords with certain NexToken characteristics
   - On root or 9th for VII+/♭II
   - Also on 1st inversion of Major when the 3rd is a passing (thus chromatic) tone
   - It emerges as a "leading", "bridging" (in pocket), or dominant" function amongst others
   - [Max Martin](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VtQorLzzbQw) creatively uses a ♭II arpeggio (lyrically, semantically & syntatically apt)
   - His lyrics are a trochaic tetrameter $$\frac{12}{8}$$: `im` per-`fect`-for | `you`: E | F-A-C | B
   - Think of the ♭II arpeggio as a substitute of the 3rd (E-`G♯`-B)
   - An insertion in a "pocket" instead of repetition
