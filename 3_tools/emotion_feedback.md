### 1 Modes
- PAIRS@JH as "Eyes" & data-collection
- YouTube comments (i.e., text)
- Save as .PDF

### 2 GPT
- Upload into GPT-4o for thematic analysis

### 3 Reinforcement
- Music: phonetics, temperament, scales, MQ-TEA, nexToken, ENTarcs
- e.g. phrygian mode, flamenco element, arpeggio, trochaic meter for "im-per-fect-for-you": E-`F-A-C`-B
- `F-A-C` insertion/substitue of 3rd (i.e. Gâ™¯)
- "Dominant" function & lyric-syntactic-semantic consonance of "imperfect" sonic elements

### 4 Attention
- P attention across all "6-step-process" to improve prediction of nexToken
- For instance we impute that we need to pay attention to Gypsies: India-Persia-Arabia-North.Africa-Spain: Andalusia-Flamenco
- That's the origin of the "exotic" otherwordly elements everyone is going nuts about but can't figure out why
- Masterful composition places `constraints` on what it admits from Andalusia into this pop song: don't want to overwhelm the masses :)
- We have spanish phrygian elements even phonetically in the openning guitar & implied rhythm without accent
- Ommitted is the performance, dance, & audience support with syncopated claps

### 5 Unveiled
- Secret behind every listeners emotional response

### 6 Bespoke
- Very personal for me since vocabulary is key element 
- Particularly for language-memory-intelligence-prediction-anticipation-feedback
