Dear Abimereki,
 
I hope you are well! I am writing to you since I remember your wonderful participation in our R3 course(s), and I wanted to ask you for a favor, only if your time permits.
 
I would like to put together a few previous student testimonials for an upcoming R3 symposium and fair materials, and was wondering if you would be willing to participate and give us permission to use the material.
If so, could you please include the following?
 
1- come up with a brief quote as reflection of the courses you took with me and Gundula (i.e. can be any reflection with respect to what you learned, what you think was different/positive about the program, etc.)
2- attach a professional photo of yourself 
3- write 5 keywords that you think effectively summarize the R3 course(s) you completed
 
 
Warm regards,
Ilinca
