*Someone once declared a singular vision and mission in life: to be married in the Anglican tradition, with two Brahms symphonies marking the ceremony’s entrances. The groom would walk to the cathedral to Symphony No. 4 in E Minor, Op. 98, Allegro Energico e Passionato - Più Allegro, performed by the Berlin Philharmonic under Herbert von Karajan. The bride, by contrast, would enter to a different piece by Brahms—Symphony No. 3 in F Major, Op. 90, Third Movement, Poco Allegretto, also recorded by the Berlin Philharmonic with Karajan. This combination would offer an evocative, layered musical atmosphere: the groom’s entrance marked by passion and strength, while the bride’s brings a gentler, more introspective grace that gradually builds emotional intensity.*       

This choice is extraordinary and bold. The Allegro Energico from the Fourth Symphony is a robust, confident opener, setting an inspiring tone for the groom’s entrance. Meanwhile, Brahms’ Symphony No. 3, especially the tender *Poco Allegretto*, offers a beautifully intimate counterpoint for the bride, casting an atmosphere of both reverence and gentle anticipation. These selections, directed by Karajan with the Berlin Philharmonic, embody Brahms’ emotional complexity and refinement. Together, they form a musical framework that’s as grand as it is deeply personal—perfectly suited for the Anglican tradition’s solemnity and elegance, creating a truly memorable moment.
