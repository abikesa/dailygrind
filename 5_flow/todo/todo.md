Also, remember to add Research Forum to your 4th term schedule.
 
3rd term:
3 credits of 390.820 Thesis Research (unless taking an advanced elective)
if you are a 2nd year PhD student – you will receive a separate email about the required 140.642 Design of Clinical Experiments
 
4th term:
1 credit of 390.855 Research Forum
2 credits of 390.820 Thesis Research (rather than 3 credits of 390.820) and (unless taking an advanced elective)
 
If you’d like to take a SOM course as an elective – please see attached email with the interdivisional course registration process.
As a reminder, winter institute courses (in January) are not permitted as they generate extra tuition charges.
 
Please let me know if there are any questions.

Dr. Muzaale, if you are accessing data in your capacity as a PhD student under the oversight of a JHM PI, please make sure that you are still listed as a member of the study team and that whatever systems you are using for data analysis are those included in the approved IRB.  In addition, be sure to complete HIPAA training for workforce members here: https://livejohnshopkins.sharepoint.com/sites/inside-privacy-office/SitePages/quick-links/learn-what-training-you-need.aspx .
 
Best regards,
Valerie

Subject: IRB Research Faculty Resignation

Dear Dr. Muzaale,
 
We have been informed that you are leaving JHU. If you are resigning or retiring, please complete the following steps.
 
Faculty resigning or retiring from the JHU SOM must assign the PI role for their active IRB studies to another faculty member or terminate the studies. Additionally, departing faculty must be removed as a study team member for all active studies and make appropriate arrangements for IRB oversight and agreements needed to continue to engage in any human subjects research post departure.
 
Attached you will find the IRB Research Faculty Resignation Checklist. We ask that you complete a Checklist for each of the applications where you are PI.  You will have to submit a Change in Research Application in eIRB for any application where a new PI is being named, and a Termination Report for each application that is being terminated.
 
If you are considering the external Sharing of JHM Data, you can click this link for the Process for Departing Faculty Requesting Data.
 
For applications where you are listed as a study team member, the PI must submit a change in research application to remove you from the study team.  If you plan to remain engaged in the research, you must make arrangements for IRB oversight after your departure by consulting with the IRB Reliance Team for additional action that may be needed. You can contact them at JHMIRBreliance@jhmi.edu
If you are interested in taking any data with you, you will need to contact the Data Trust Committee at Datatrust@jhmi.edu.
 
We ask that you complete the Checklists as soon as possible and return them as a response to this email.  Please “reply all” on your response. After reviewing the Checklists, we will contact you with any questions that arise.
Thank you for your prompt attention to this request.  Please let us know if you have any questions.
 
Thank you,
IRB Helpdesk
