Hi everyone.  As a reminder, all continuing PhD students must be registered for a minimum of 3 credits each term, until graduation.  The SIS registration system for 3rd and 4th terms will open next week on 11/11/24 - please remember to register for both terms. 
 
Also, remember to add Research Forum to your 4th term schedule.
 
3rd term:
3 credits of 390.820 Thesis Research (unless taking an advanced elective)
if you are a 2nd year PhD student – you will receive a separate email about the required 140.642 Design of Clinical Experiments
 
4th term:
1 credit of 390.855 Research Forum
2 credits of 390.820 Thesis Research (rather than 3 credits of 390.820) and (unless taking an advanced elective)
 
If you’d like to take a SOM course as an elective – please see attached email with the interdivisional course registration process.
As a reminder, winter institute courses (in January) are not permitted as they generate extra tuition charges.
 
Please let me know if there are any questions.
